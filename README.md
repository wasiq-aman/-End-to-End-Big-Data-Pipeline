# End-to-End-Big-Data-Pipeline

Designed and implemented a fully automated data pipeline integrating PostgreSQL, MinIO, Apache Spark, TimescaleDB, and Power BI. Raw transactional data was extracted from PostgreSQL and ingested into MinIO, which served as a centralized data lake leveraging Parquet format and partitioned storage for scalability and efficiency. Apache Spark was utilized as the distributed processing framework to perform large-scale data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment, ensuring data quality and preparing it for downstream analytics. The processed data was then stored back into a dedicated clean data bucket in MinIO, maintaining a clear separation between raw and refined datasets.

From the clean bucket, refined datasets were ingested into TimescaleDB hypertables, enabling high-throughput ingestion, efficient time-series aggregations, and fast querying across both real-time and historical records. Power BI dashboards were directly connected to TimescaleDB, providing interactive analytics and business insights with automated refresh cycles. The entire pipeline was orchestrated and scheduled through cron jobs, ensuring end-to-end automation, reliability, and production-grade execution with minimal manual intervention.
